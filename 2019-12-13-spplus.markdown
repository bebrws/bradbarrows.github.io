A demo video:
{% img /images/spplus.gif %}

The code is located at
[My SPPlusSIMBL project Github page](https://github.com/bebrws/SPPlusSIMBL)

This is a MacForge (used to be MySIMBL) plugin that hooks into Spotlight.

When you type any command starting with "bb " and ending in ";" it will execute it in a zsh shell and bring up a transparent window showing the command output. It is basically a transparent terminal window which you can bring up from spotlight and hide through spotlight.

Just type "c;" to make the terminal window disappear;

Once you bring the transparent terminal window up with some command like:
```bb ls;```

you can click in the bottom TextView on the bottom of the window and type any command. When the command ends in ";" it will be executed.

The demo video probably shows this better than I will explain it.
